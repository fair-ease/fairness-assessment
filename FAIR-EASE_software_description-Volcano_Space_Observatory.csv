Field,Value
Description,"SO2 Flux Calculator : Python implementation of the volcanic SO2 flux calculator add-on of the VolcPlume web platform, in the framework of the Volcano Space Observatory Portal. Uses Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI-derived SO2 mass burden extracted in nested circular domains centred on a volcanic target to estimate the daily-averaged SO2 mass flux released by the volcano. The algorithm is applied in the back-end of the on-demand web service « SO2 Flux Calculator » operated by AERIS/ICARE at http://jupyter.icare.univ-lille.fr:5057/so2-flux-calculator, in the framework of the Volcano Space Observatory Portal"

Provenance Tracking,"The version of software used for computing the output files is written in the header of the output files. The version is determined on the basis of the git hash of the package, which traces the latest commit submitted on the repository for the version of the code used for the output file calculation with the command: Source: https://git.icare.univ-lille.fr/icare-public/so2-flux-calculator (version %s)\n' % get_git_hash_of_package()"
Software Heritage,"A snapshot of the code has been submitted manually to Software Heritage : https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse/origin/directory/?origin_url=https://git.icare.univ-lille.fr/icare-public/so2-flux-calculator.
